        New and update rewrite of the popular Google Anaytics for Joomla FREE. Asynchronous code for Google Analytics is now
        old and has been superseeded by Google's new "UNIVERSAL ANALYTICS".

        This plugin will allow you to choose between the two options of the new universal analytics code or the old
        asynchronous version of the analytics code.
        Read the documentation at: http://pbwebdev.com/blog/asynchronous-google-analytics-plugin-for-joomla for more
        information.

                       in milliseconds. By default, session timeout is set to 30 minutes. Session timeout is used
                       to compute visits, since a visit ends after 30 minutes of browser inactivity or upon browser
                       exit. If you want to change the definition of a 'session' for your particular needs, you can
                       pass in the number of milliseconds to define a new value. This will impact the Visits reports
                       in every section where the number of visits are calculated, and where visits are used in
                       computing other values. For example, the number of visits will increase if you shorten the
                       session timeout, and will decrease if you increase the session timeout. You can change the
                       expiration timeout to 0 to indicate that this cookie should be deleted when the

                       a larger rate. This will provide increased granularity for page load time and other Site
